Scat Original Rules vs. My New Rules 

Before: Players will lose lives until someone is declared the winner. <br />
Now: One or more players win and the game is reset.
  
Before: When a player knocks, every other player is given a fourth card that will add on to the score they had with three cards.<br />
Now: When a player knocks, no fourth card is given to the other players and the winner is deduced through the scores of each player's three cards.
